Priority-Deque

==============



This project is my implementation of a priority deque (double-ended priority queue) as a C++ class template.

Goals:
* Interface similar to STL.
  * Status: Complete.
  * `priority_deque` implements the `std::priority_queue` interface.
  * Additional functions, for double-ended access and random-access among others, are in STL style.
* Interface in Boost style.
  * Status: Incomplete.
* Performance competitive with STL's priority_queue.
  * Status: Close.
  * Benchmarks indicate ~20% slower performance in `push`, ~15% slower in `pop`. (GCC, -O3)
  * Bulk-loading is optionally threaded, with the following benchmarked performance ratios (deque time : queue time, smaller is better):
    * 1.228 : 1 (1 CPU core)
    * 0.874 : 1 (2 CPU cores)
    * 0.545 : 1 (4 CPU cores)
* Provide the strongest exception-safety guarantee possible without compromising performance.
  * Status: Complete.
  * Most operations, including provide the strong (rollback) exception-safety guarantee if comparison throws.
  * Bulk-loading operations such as `merge` cannot provide this guarantee without compromising performance.
  * The random-access `update` method can only provide the strong guarantee by copying an element or using move semantics.
* Provide thread safety comparable to that of STL structures.
  * Status: Complete.
  * Functions have no side-effects besides the obvious (deque or interval heap may be altered), and can safely be called in threads, though a single queue should not be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. Multiple reads are okay; simultaneous read-write and write-write may cause race conditions.
