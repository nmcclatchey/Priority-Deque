Compiling and running `tests.cpp` verifies the following:
* `priority_deque.hpp` and `interval_heap.hpp` may be compiled without issue.
* The `priority_deque` class template does not violate its invariants during typical use.
* The `priority_deque` class template (abreviated PD in output) provides performance similar to that of `std::priority_queue` (abreviated PQ in output).
